# Aurelius
Aurelius is an enterprise‑grade decentralized governance and treasury orchestration platform designed for modern DAOs and on‑chain organizations. Built with performance, security, and automation at its core

##  Vision

Aurelius is crafted to feel less like a typical Web3 dashboard and more like a **digital boardroom for decentralized organizations** — opinionated, secure, and highly automated.
